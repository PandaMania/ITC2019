<h4>Problem statement and motivation</h4>
Creating timetables is a commonly encountered issue across the world in schools, universities and other establishments. 
For a long time, timetables have been hand-crafted, but this is difficult to do for most problems and becomes impossible 
when approaching a large number of courses and students like that in a university. Computer-aided timetable generation 
is a complex problem typically involving very long computation times to produce. This is due to the large number of 
constraints involved, such as students all taking different combinations of courses, courses having room requirements 
and travel time between rooms. Consequently, a large amount of research has gone into finding effective and efficient 
ways of automating the process. The Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT) conference started in 1995 and 
deals with the problem of timetable generation, with advancements in the field mainly motivated through competitions.

This project aims to participate in the 2019 International Timetabling Competition \cite{itc2019}. This will involve 
researching and implementing a variety of methods in order to produce timetables for simulated problems provided by 
the competition with the goal of producing good timetable solutions that might rival other competing teams.

<h4>Approaches</h4>
The university timetable scheduling problem consists of deciding on a course layout, selecting a room
and a time frame for the classes, which belong to their respective course layout and assigning students
to the courses. This assignment of variables can be fully described by a vector of integer values. 
The challenge is finding a vector of integer values that respect all the hard 
constraints and minimizes the penalty received from the soft constraints of the problem instance. 
In order to solve the scheduling problem, several approaches will be considered.

<h5>Integer Linear Programming</h5>
<h5>Simulated Annealing</h5>
<h5>Genetic Algorithms</h5>

<h4>1 Problem statement and motivation</h4>
Creating timetables is a commonly encountered issue across the world in schools, universities and other establishments. 
For a long time, timetables have been hand-crafted, but this is difficult to do for most problems and becomes impossible 
when approaching a large number of courses and students like that in a university. Computer-aided timetable generation 
is a complex problem typically involving very long computation times to produce. This is due to the large number of 
constraints involved, such as students all taking different combinations of courses, courses having room requirements 
and travel time between rooms. Consequently, a large amount of research has gone into finding effective and efficient 
ways of automating the process. The Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling (PATAT) conference started in 1995 and 
deals with the problem of timetable generation, with advancements in the field mainly motivated through competitions.

This project aims to participate in the 2019 International Timetabling Competition \cite{itc2019}. This will involve 
researching and implementing a variety of methods in order to produce timetables for simulated problems provided by 
the competition with the goal of producing good timetable solutions that might rival other competing teams.

<h4>2 Competition overview</h4>
<h5>2.1 General rules</h5>
The rules of the tournament highlight the importance of following the spirit of the rules and 
not so much the letter of the rules. As such the organisers reserve the right to change them at 
any time and may disqualify any team that doesn't follow the spirit of the competition. Participants 
are asked to keep in mind that the goal of the tournament is to encourage research in the field.

<h5>2.2 Solution generation</h5>
The solutions generated must satisfy all hard constraints but will be scored on the number of soft
constraints satisfied. February 1 and June 1 are milestone deadlines, November 18 is the final deadline for submissions.
Teams must submit a short paper along with the solution on the last deadline. The algorithm must 
not "know" the instance. It can analyse the problem and set parameters automatically but cannot
"recognise" the specific instances. There are no time nor computational constraints on how solutions are generated.

<h5>2.3 Constraints</h5>
As the problem is complex some clashes may occur in the timetable. These are regulated by constraints:

<br/><br/>
Hard constraints (cannot be broken):
<ul>
	<li>Assigning a class to a room and a time when that room is unavailable.</li>
	<li>Assigning two classes in overlapping times to the same room.</li>
	<li>Distributions specified as hard.</li>
</ul>


Soft constraints (incur a penalty):
<ul>
	<li>Some of the rooms and set of time choices for a class have a penalty assigned as they are less 
        desirable, but this is not strictly a clash).</li>
    <li>Student conflict: A student having two classes at overlapping times (including travel times). 
        This is penalised with a constant penalty no matter the length of the overlap.</li>
    <li>Distributions specified as soft.</li>
</ul>

The penalties for the soft constraints are weighed together with parameters given at the top of the problem.

<h5>2.4 Ranking</h5>
Ranking is done by points assigned for the placement of the solution submitted for each individual
instance. Therefore a first place gets you more points than second and so on. The exact points 
can be seen in Figure 3. Later submission rounds count for more overall points.

Once the final ranking is complete 5 finalists will be selected and will be invited to attend the PATAT
2020 conference where the final standings will be revealed. Source code isn't required in the submission
but may be asked for to ensure that there was no cheating.

<h4>4 Approaches</h4>
The university timetable scheduling problem consists of deciding on a course layout, selecting a room
and a time frame for the classes, which belong to their respective course layout and assigning students
to the courses. This assignment of variables can be fully described by a vector of integer values. 
The challenge is finding a vector of integer values that respect all the hard 
constraints and minimizes the penalty received from the soft constraints of the problem instance. 
In order to solve the scheduling problem, several approaches will be considered.

<h5>4.1 Integer Linear Programming</h5>
The approach of integer linear programming (ILP) was investigated for example in order to solve the 
physician rostering problem \cite{patat03} and solving the music school timetabling problem\cite{patat18},
which shows many similarities to the university timetabling problem. All of them try to feasible solution
as a starting point for other techniques like directed random search.

The hard and soft constraints of the timetabling problem can be described as linear relationships 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Ax\leq&space;b" title="Ax\leq b" />
with matrix 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times&space;n}" title="A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}" />, vector 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b\in\mathbb{R}^m" title="b\in\mathbb{R}^m" />, 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m" title="m" /> number of constraints and 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n" title="n" />

number of integer variables 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_i\geq&space;0" title="x_i\geq 0" />. The optimization 
goal is then to try to maximize the scalar product 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c^\intercal&space;x" title="c^\intercal x" />, that corresponds to the penalty 
due to the violation of the soft constraints\cite[~p.32]{multiagent}. 

This approach would be implemented using the java version of the Gurobi Software\cite{gurobi}, which is 
a mathematical solving tool for linear programming, in order to obtain at least a feasible solution for 
the problem. One usage of this technique would be to let the ILP run after attaining a feasible solution
to find if a longer run time will yield a more optimal solution. Alternatively, it could be used to find 
a feasible solution as a starting point for other techniques such as directed random search (see subsection \ref{DRS}).

<h5>4.2 Simulated Annealing</h5>
This approach is a tested and tried method for solving combinatorial problems such as the travelling salesman 
problem \cite{simulated}. These problems are similar to the problem of timetable scheduling as there is a finite 
set of feasible discrete solutions, the possible timetables. The space of these possible solutions is large enough
that searching exhaustively for the global optimum becomes infeasible. 

Simulated annealing starts solving a problem from an arbitrary initial solution
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x" title="x" />  and tries to improve it. For this
a solution that is similar to the current solution 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y" title="y" /> is selected randomly in the local neighborhoood and its quality
 is determined by the cost function 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f" title="f" />. The new solution is chosen with some probability that is 
dependent on its quality. However, this also 
means that a worse solution can be selected, but this is intended. Moving to a worse solution allows this method
to escape local optima and search the solution space more thoroughly. The probability 
<p align="center">
	<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p=\min\left(1,\left(-\frac{f(y)-f(x))}{T}\right)\right)" title="p=\min\left(1,\left(-\frac{f(y)-f(x))}{T}\right)\right)" />
</p>
of accepting a solution that is worse than the current one decreases over time ensuring that the method converges to an optimum.
In simulated annealing this is solved by reducing the temperature 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T" title="T" /> monotonously to 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0" title="0" />. 
An approach for this project would be to use simulated annealing to optimise for the timetable scheduling problem. 
For this a way must be found to represent this problem in terms of a function to be optimised and its parameters, 
or solutions, and a way for simulated annealing to find a solution that is close to the current one. The function 
to be optimised can be defined in terms of the weight of constraints that are violated by a solution. A solution 
that violates a lot of constraints will get a higher cost than a solution that satisfies them. Hard constraints 
should have a high cost compared to the soft constraint to keep the solutions in the feasible region of the search space.
Lastly, the method requires a way to transition from a solution to the next. Papers \cite{simulated} and \cite{mosa} 
use various swap moves to transition between solutions. A swap is merely an exchange of some parts of the solution 
with another. For example, two lectures can switch the periods in which they are taught. These methods can be eventually 
be supplemented with new methods.

<h5>4.3 Genetic Algorithms</h5>
A genetic algorithm belongs to the class of local search algorithms, that are used to solve optimization problems. 
It is initialized with a population of 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?k" title="k" /> individuals, that will reproduce and compete against each
 with respect to some fitness measure based on 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c^\intercal&space;x" title="c^\intercal x" /> (see subsection \ref{ILP}). 
The population follows a repeated generation 
cycle of fitness evaluation, selection, reproduction, crossover, and mutation \cite[~p.126-128]{russellnorvig}.
The vector 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x=(x_1,&space;..,&space;x_n)" title="x=(x_1, .., x_n)" /> of integer values 
can be used for the genome representation in the genetic algorithm either
in binary or real-valued form. This approach will be used in combination with an ILP, that would provide one or more 
feasible solutions, which could be used for initialization of the genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm would then 
perform a localized search in order to fine-tune the integer parameters 
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_i" title="x_i" /> so that an optimized solution with respect
to the penalty of the soft constraints can be achieved. In the literature, a genetic algorithm was used for the
 problem of scheduling physicians in an emergency room \cite{PUENTE20091232}.
